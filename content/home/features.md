## Who We Are

This group aims to bring together machine learning researchers, data scientists, and domain experts from diverse backgrounds, career stages, and disciplines to develop algorithms and tools that transfer knowledge across tasks and domains to improve the performance of learning algorithms on data of multiple modalities in real-world applications. We call this problem meta-learning for multimodal data, adopting a broad definition of meta-learning to bring researchers and practitioners in related areas together.

For example, in healthcare, there are data of multiple modalities including medical images, health-monitoring data, electronic health records, and multi-omics data. In practice, clinicians often make decisions using data from more than one modality and leveraging experience from related tasks/domains. To advance AI for such real-world problems, we aim to collaboratively develop meta-learning algorithms and tools that can leverage experience and knowledge on individual modalities, domains, and tasks to tackle real-world challenges in analysing data of multiple modalities across multiple domains for various tasks.
